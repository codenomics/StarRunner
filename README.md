STARRUNNER
==========

All your Star Citizen tools in one window, with a tab for each tool.
The CitRunner tab looks up a Star Citizen player by their handle and shows
their public RSI profile: avatar, citizen record number, enlisted date,
location, fluency, badge, organizations (with their rank) and bio.
The MineRunner tab reads the mining scan number off your screen in Star
Citizen and shows which rock it is in a small see-through overlay.
The LangRunner tab edits the game's language file (global.ini) and keeps your
edits so they can be put back on every new version. The Notes tab is a light
notepad: a list of notes on the left and the text on the right.

  Documents). Don't run it from inside the zip.

"Windows protected your PC"? Click "More info" -> "Run anyway".

USING IT
--------
- Click a tab at the top to switch tools. StarRunner remembers the tab you
  had open. Drag a tab sideways to put the tabs in your own order. The window
  can be resized and maximized.
- Home tab: a quick look at each tool, plus a Look picker with five color
  looks (Synthwave, Ocean, Ember, Forest, Graphite). Pick one and click
  Restart now to use it.
- CitRunner tab: type a player's handle (the name in the address of their
  RSI profile) and press Enter or click Look up.
- MineRunner tab:
  1. Click Pick area, switch to the game and scan a rock so the number shows.
     After 5 seconds the screen freezes - drag a box around the number.
     (Any game window mode works: Borderless, Windowed or Fullscreen.)
  2. Click Start reading. The overlay shows e.g. "3x Titanium" while the
     number is on screen. It keeps working while you use the other tabs.
  The Signatures button opens the table of scan numbers (you can fix or add
  values after game updates). Press F1 for more help.
- LangRunner tab:
  1. Click Choose language file (or drag a global.ini onto the window). "Get
     newest" downloads a community language pack from GitHub.
  2. Search the list, click an entry and type in the Current value box.
  3. Save my changes keeps just your edits in a small file (Documents\LangRunner).
     When a new version of the file comes out, open it and click Load my
     changes to put your edits back on it.

  by themselves and are plain text files in Documents\StarRunner Notes.

  to see its Overview, History, Manifesto, Charter and a Members list.

GOOD TO KNOW
------------
- The CitRunner tab only reads public pages on robertsspaceindustries.com.
  Nothing about you is sent anywhere.
- The MineRunner tab only looks at the box you picked on your screen, using
  the text reader built into Windows, and never touches the game. It needs an
  English text-reader language in Windows (Settings > Time & language >
  Language & region); most PCs already have it. Parts a player keeps private show as "-".
- The LangRunner tab only writes to the game's language folder when you click
  Save to game (and it backs up the old file first). Language packs come
  from public GitHub pages; nothing about you is sent.
- RSI has no official lookup service, so if RSI changes its web page some
  details may come up blank.
- Your recent lookups, settings and the MineRunner signature table are kept in
  %APPDATA%\StarRunner. LangRunner changes files and downloaded packs are kept
  in Documents\LangRunner, and your notes in Documents\StarRunner Notes.
- Updates: a few seconds after it starts, StarRunner checks GitHub for a newer
  version (it only reads the public release page; nothing is sent). If there
  is one, "Update available" shows at the top right; click it to update. With
  the installer, it downloads and runs the new installer for you; with the
  no-install zip, it opens the download page. Right-click "Check for updates"
  to turn the startup check on or off.
- If something goes wrong, StarRunner-log.txt next to StarRunner.exe says what.
- To remove StarRunner: delete its folder and %APPDATA%\StarRunner.
